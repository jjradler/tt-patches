# tt-patches

This is a collection of Pure Data patches intended for use on [mxmxmx's Terminal Tedium](https://github.com/mxmxmx/terminal_tedium) Eurorack module. 

I have forked the original repository by [wilsontr](https://github.com/wilsontr) to play around with it and build my own extensions for the Terminal Tedium. 

## Basil

[Basil](https://github.com/wilsontr/tt-patches/tree/master/basil) is a dual VCO with controls for waveshaping and intermodulation. It's good at creating harsh, metallic, digital textures. It's based on an algorithm in [Noise Engineering's Loquelic Iteritas](https://www.noiseengineering.us/loquelic-iteritas/) Eurorack module. 

## Pierre

[Pierre](https://github.com/wilsontr/tt-patches/tree/master/pierre) is an experimental tape machine simulator based on the [Make Noise Phonogene](http://www.makenoisemusic.com/modules/phonogene) Eurorack module. This patch should be considered unstable and a work-in-progress.
